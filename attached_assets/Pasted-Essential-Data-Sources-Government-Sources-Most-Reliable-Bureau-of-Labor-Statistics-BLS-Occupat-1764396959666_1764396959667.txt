Essential Data Sources
Government Sources (Most Reliable)

Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) provides detailed wage data by occupation, industry, and location
O*NET Database: Links to BLS data with detailed job descriptions and skill requirements
Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) provides demographic salary data
H1B Salary Database: Department of Labor's foreign labor certification data shows actual salaries paid

Commercial & Crowdsourced Data

Glassdoor API: Self-reported salaries with company specifics
Levels.fyi: Tech-focused compensation including equity
Payscale: Comprehensive salary profiles
Indeed/LinkedIn Salary Insights: Job posting salary ranges (increasingly available due to pay transparency laws)

Core Dataset Structure
Your dataset should include these key fields:
Job Information

Job title (standardized)
SOC code (Standard Occupational Classification)
Industry (NAICS code)
Company size (ranges: 1-50, 51-200, 201-1000, 1000+)
Company type (public/private/nonprofit/government)

Compensation Data

Base salary (min, max, median, 25th/75th percentile)
Total compensation (including bonuses, equity)
Hourly vs. salary designation
Currency and year of data

Location Variables

State
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
Cost of living index
Remote work eligibility

Experience & Skills

Years of experience required
Education level
Key skills/certifications
Management level (IC, Manager, Director, VP, C-suite)

Data Quality Considerations
Validation Rules

Remove outliers (salaries below minimum wage or above 99.5 percentile)
Standardize job titles using O*NET taxonomy
Normalize for inflation using CPI adjustments
Account for regional cost of living differences

Confidence Scoring
Create a confidence score based on:

Data source reliability (government = high, self-reported = medium)
Sample size (more data points = higher confidence)
Data recency (recent data scores higher)
Completeness of information

Implementation Recommendations
Data Pipeline

Collection: Set up automated scrapers/API calls for regular updates
Cleaning: Standardize titles, remove duplicates, handle missing values
Enrichment: Add cost of living adjustments, skill matching
Validation: Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy
Storage: Use a database that supports efficient querying (PostgreSQL with proper indexing)

Privacy & Legal Compliance

Ensure compliance with data source terms of service
Anonymize company-specific data where required
Follow pay transparency law requirements by state
Include appropriate disclaimers about data accuracy

Benchmarking Algorithm Features
Your coach should adjust salaries based on:

Geographic location (cost of living multiplier)
Years of experience (typically 3-5% per year early career, flattening later)
Company size (larger companies often pay 10-20% more)
Industry (tech/finance typically pay premiums)
Remote vs. on-site (remote may be -5% to -15%)

Sample Data Collection Script Structure
pythondef build_salary_dataset():
    # 1. Collect from multiple sources
    bls_data = fetch_bls_data()
    h1b_data = fetch_h1b_data()
    glassdoor_data = fetch_glassdoor_api()
    
    # 2. Standardize format
    normalized_data = normalize_salary_records(all_sources)
    
    # 3. Enhance with calculations
    enhanced_data = add_percentiles(normalized_data)
    enhanced_data = adjust_for_inflation(enhanced_data)
    enhanced_data = add_cost_of_living(enhanced_data)
    
    # 4. Quality scoring
    final_dataset = calculate_confidence_scores(enhanced_data)
    
    return final_dataset
Key Success Factors
For Accuracy:

Combine multiple data sources to reduce bias
Weight recent data more heavily (last 12-18 months)
Account for total compensation, not just base salary
Include sample size to indicate reliability

For Usability:

Provide salary ranges, not just point estimates
Include contextual factors (company stage, benefits, equity)
Show comparable titles for flexibility
Enable filtering by multiple criteria simultaneously
