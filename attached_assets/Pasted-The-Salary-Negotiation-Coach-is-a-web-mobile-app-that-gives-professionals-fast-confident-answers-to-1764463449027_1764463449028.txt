The Salary Negotiation Coach is a web/mobile app that gives professionals fast, confident answers to three questions: Am I underpaid? → What should I say? → How hard can I push? The “Minimum Viable Negotiator” bundles three core features—a lowball scorecard, a tone-adjustable script generator, and a leverage quiz—into a simple flow that takes a user from anxiety and guesswork to a specific plan of action in minutes.
Below are detailed user stories for each feature, including how they’re accessed, used, and what the user sees.
