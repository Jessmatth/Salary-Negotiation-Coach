1. Inputs the Script Generator Should Use

The script engine should use these inputs (from Scorecard + Leverage Quiz + user choices):

Required:

Role (e.g., “Senior Product Manager”)

Years of experience

Company name making the offer

Location

Offer details:

Base salary

Bonus / equity summary (if available)

Market range from Scorecard (e.g., $180–195k)

Leverage tier (Low / Moderate / High)

Suggested raise range (e.g., 10–15%)

Tone slider value (Polite ↔ Aggressive)

Nice to have:

Whether this is:

External offer

Internal promotion / raise

Retention/counter scenario

The app generates only the body text so the user can add their own greeting and sign-off.

2. Standard Script Structure (Body Only)

Every script can follow the same internal structure:

Gratitude & enthusiasm

Offer recap

Market / value framing (use years of experience, role, company, location)

State the market gap (Scorecard)

The ask (number/range, driven by leverage + tone)

Risk/safety line (“open to discussion”)

Closing sentence

No greeting, no name — just the core paragraphs.

3. Tone Rules (Polite → Bold)

The tone slider controls how each “slot” is worded:

Amount of hedging vs directness

How explicit the ask is

Whether other offers are mentioned

Whether language leans “hope to explore” vs “I’m targeting / I expect”

You can treat the slider as 3 levels.

Tone Level 1 – Polite / Soft

Use when:

Low leverage, and/or slider far left.

Characteristics:

Hedging (“wondering if…”).

Emphasis on enthusiasm and mutual fit.

Ask often phrased as a question or “explore” language.

Example phrasings:

“I’m really excited about the opportunity to join [Company] as a [Role].”

“I was wondering if there might be any flexibility in the base salary.”

“I’d appreciate it if we could explore bringing the offer closer to [X].”

Tone Level 2 – Professional / Firm

Use when:

Moderate leverage, or slider near middle.

Characteristics:

Direct but respectful.

Clear request, justified by experience + market.

Less hedging, more “I’d like to…”

Examples:

“Given my [X] years of experience and the scope of this role, I’d like to discuss an adjustment to the base salary.”

“Based on market data and my background, I believe a range of [X–Y] would be more aligned.”

“Is there room to move the base salary to [X] to reflect that?”

Tone Level 3 – Bold / Aggressive

Use when:

High leverage and slider near right.

Characteristics:

Clear anchor and expectation.

Explicit reference to other offers / deadlines (without being rude).

Language like “I’m targeting” or “I expect”.

Examples:

“Given my track record and other opportunities I’m considering, I’m targeting a base salary of [X].”

“If we can get to [X] base with the current equity and bonus structure, I’d be comfortable signing quickly.”

“Other offers I’m evaluating are in the [X–Y] range, so I’d like to see if [Company] can come closer to that.”

4. Mapping Leverage & Scorecard to the Ask

You already have:

Leverage Tier: Low / Moderate / High

Suggested Range: e.g., 5–10%, 10–15%, or 15–25%

Offer & Market Range: from Scorecard

Let:

offer = current base salary

min_pct, max_pct = suggested percentage range

mid_pct = middle of that range

Then:

Polite + Low leverage:

Don’t anchor super hard; talk about “closer to” a number or a small range.

Use something near min_pct.

Firm + Moderate leverage:

State a clear target near mid_pct:

“around [offer * (1 + mid_pct)]”.

Bold + High leverage:

Anchor near max_pct:

“in the neighborhood of [offer * (1 + max_pct)]”.

Also adjust if the Scorecard shows:

Offer is already fair or strong:

Tone down the ask:

“small adjustment”

“bringing it closer to the top of the range”

or shift to non-salary items (title, equity, flexibility).

5. Phrase Banks & Templates (Body Only)
5.1 External Offer Template – Body Only

This is what you generate (user adds greeting + sign-off themselves).

Section 1 – Gratitude & enthusiasm

Polite:

Thank you again for the offer to join [Company] as a [Role]. I really appreciate the time the team has invested, and I’m excited about the opportunity.

Firm:

Thank you for the offer to join [Company] as a [Role]. I’ve enjoyed the conversations with the team and I’m enthusiastic about the role.

Bold:

Thank you for the offer to join [Company] as a [Role]. I’m excited about the impact this role can have and the chance to contribute at [Company].

Section 2 – Offer recap

As I understand it, the offer includes a base salary of [Offer], plus [bonus/equity summary if known].

(If bonus/equity unknown, just keep base.)

Section 3 – Market / value framing

Polite:

Given my [X] years of experience in [domain] and the scope of this position, I took some time to compare the offer with typical ranges for similar roles in [location].

Firm:

With [X] years of experience in [domain] and the responsibilities we discussed, I’ve reviewed current market ranges for similar roles in [location].

Bold:

With [X] years in [domain] and a track record of [brief result/impact], I’ve been comparing this offer to others I’m considering and to market rates for similar roles in [location].

Section 4 – State the market gap (Scorecard)

From what I’m seeing, a typical range for this kind of role is approximately [MarketRangeLow–MarketRangeHigh].

If they’re above market:

From what I’m seeing, the offer is already competitive compared to typical ranges of [MarketRangeLow–MarketRangeHigh].

Section 5 – The ask (driven by leverage + tone)

Examples based on tier & tone:

Low leverage + Polite (5–10%):

I’m very interested in joining the team, and I’m wondering if there might be flexibility to bring the base salary closer to [target or small range] to better reflect that market range.

Moderate leverage + Firm (10–15%):

Based on this, I’d like to see if we can adjust the base salary to around [target], which I believe is a fair reflection of my experience and the role’s scope.

High leverage + Bold (15–25%):

Given this and the other opportunities I’m evaluating in the [comparison range] band, I’m looking for a base salary in the neighborhood of [target] to feel comfortable moving forward quickly with [Company].

If the offer is already at/above market, generate alternatives like:

I’d love to explore a small adjustment to bring the base closer to [target], or alternatively consider enhancements to equity, signing bonus, or other aspects of the package.

Section 6 – Risk / collaboration line

Polite:

I’m definitely flexible and open to discussing what’s possible on your end.

Firm:

I’m happy to talk through what’s feasible and find a number that works for both of us.

Bold:

If there’s room to get to that level, I’d be excited to move ahead and wrap this up quickly.

Section 7 – Closing sentence

Polite:

Thank you again for the offer and for considering this adjustment.

Firm:

Thanks again for the offer and for taking the time to review this.

Bold:

I appreciate your consideration and I’m looking forward to hearing what might be possible.

5.2 Internal Raise / Promotion Variant – Body Only

Swap in internal-language blocks for Sections 3–5:

Value framing:

Over the past [X] years at [Company], I’ve [brief impact summary: “led [project], improved [metric], delivered [result]”]. Given that and what I’m seeing for similar roles in the market, I’d like to discuss how my compensation aligns with that level of responsibility and contribution.

Ask (tone-adjusted):

Polite:

I’d appreciate exploring a base salary closer to [target] to better reflect that scope.

Firm:

I’d like to discuss adjusting my base salary to around [target] to bring it in line with the impact and responsibilities of this role.

Bold:

Given these results and current market levels, I’m targeting a base salary of [target] and would like to align my compensation accordingly.

6. Edge Cases to Plan For

Offer above market

Don’t encourage a huge percentage ask.

Emphasize:

Small tweaks (“small adjustment”)

Non-salary components (equity, signing bonus, role scope, title, flexibility).

Very low leverage + weak company financials

Default to Polite tone.

Suggest modest ask or focus on non-cash improvements.

Avoid bold references to other offers if they’re not strong.

High leverage + multiple offers + urgent company

Use Bold tone, explicit reference to other offers and deadlines:

“other opportunities I’m evaluating”

“if we can get to X, I can commit quickly.”

No base salary known

Generate more qualitative asks:

“toward the upper end of the typical range you’re seeing for this role”

“a bit closer to the [MarketRangeHigh] end of the range”

Prompt user in UI: “Add your base salary to get a concrete target number.”
